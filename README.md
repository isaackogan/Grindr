## FEBRUARY 6TH, 2025 - CEASE & DECIST

The following notification was on Thursday, February 6th, 2025:

```
Hi Isaac Kogan,

Grindr Inc. and the affiliates (“the Company”) operate Grindr, a social media platform that is highly appreciated and renowned among the users worldwide. The Company possesses a portfolio of intellectual property rights including trademarks "Grindr" and huge collection of data generated by both the Company and users on the platform worldwide. The Company is entitled to restrain unauthorized use of such rights.

The software at https://pypi.org/project/Grindr/ violates the law, GitHub’s Terms, Grindr’s Terms, and endangers the safety of Grindr users by facilitating unauthorized access to the user’s location and exposing the user to real threats of anti-LGBT violence, as well as spam and bot activity. Therefore, Grindr requests that the package be taken down.

As the distributor, you are liable to the infringing behavior, and any damages caused by it, and we thus request that you stop the abovementioned infringing behavior.

If you do not have the permission and continue the abovementioned infringing behavior, we will take legal actions accordingly.

We look forward to your reply.
```

While they did not specify this GitHub repository, they clearly intended to.
This project's GitHub page and PyPi package have been **removed** in compliance with Grindr & the law immediately.

### DO NOT MAINTAIN PUBLIC FORKS - YOU WILL BE SUED & I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE

## IMPORTANT: NOTE TO CURRENT USERS

This package requires monthly updates, they are very difficult to do, and you must be an expert in reverse-engineering, as well as the Grindr API. It took me 2 years to reach the level of expertise to be able to create this project.

If you built a system around this project and need to continue using it, keep reading:

1. **I am maintaining a PRIVATE API** for personal uses.
2. I grant a VERY LIMITED number of people access to the private api for a monthly fee. Contact me at `info@isaackogan.com` to discuss.
4. If you used this package, it will **stop working very soon** as Grindr intend to completely block access through it & pursue legal action against those that use it for commercial purposes.
5. **Grindr are able to identify usage of this library with 100% accuracy & will ban your accounts for using it. The private fork has bypasses built in.**

If you want to access this package in the future, you must contact me, and we can set up a call.
